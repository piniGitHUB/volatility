# Introduction #

We always make an effort to keep the code in svn trunk as stable as possible, while preparing it for the next release. For that reason, we may fork and perform development in a separate branch and then merge it back in with trunk after the necessary testing.

The list below describes the existing branches. To access the code, use the following command:

```
$ svn checkout http://volatility.googlecode.com/svn/branches/<name>
```

  * **Volatility-1.3.2** - the Volatility 1.3.2 code (never officially released)
  * **Volatility-1.3.3** - the Volatility 1.3.3 code (never officially released)
  * **Volatility-2.0.1** - a branch for bug fixes to the 2.0 release
  * **2.3-devel** - the branch used for staging the Mac support, ARM support, and other features in 2.3 (also see MacMemoryForensics)
  * **scudette** - the "technology preview" branch managed by Michael Cohen (also see TechPreviewBranch)
