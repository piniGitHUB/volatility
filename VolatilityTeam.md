# Introduction #

Volatility is open source, so there are countless contributors throughout the community. However, this page identifies the few individuals with commit rights to the project and who have contributed a significant amount of code and time to the project over the years. Please also see the [AUTHORS.txt](http://code.google.com/p/volatility/source/browse/trunk/AUTHORS.txt) and [CREDITS.txt](http://code.google.com/p/volatility/source/browse/trunk/CREDITS.txt) files in the source code package.

# Core Developers #

  * **Mike Auty** has spent time in both industrial and academic settings carrying out penetration testing as well as security research. His work has allowed him to gain experience in a number of random and disconnected technologies ranging from VoIP, Bluetooth and RFID to Sat-Nav devices and Firewire. Mike's Firewire research led him into the world of volatile memory forensics,  where he became a developer on the Volatility project.  In what's left of his spare time Mike volunteers as a Gentoo developer which has given him an in-depth knowledge of linux systems, software and headaches.

  * **Andrew Case** ([@attrc](https://twitter.com/attrc)) is a research engineer at Terremark where he is responsible for research and development projects related to memory, disk, and network forensics. He is also a GIAC-certified digital forensics investigator and has conducted numerous large scale investigations. Andrew's previous experience includes penetration tests, source code audits, and binary analysis for large corporations and products. Andrew is the co-developer of Registry Decoder, a National Institute of Justice funded forensics application, as well as a developer on the Volatility memory analysis project. He has delivered trainings in the field of digital forensics to a number of private and public organizations as well as at industry conferences. Andrew's primary research focus is physical memory analysis, and he has published a number of peer-reviewed papers in the field. He has presented his research at conferences including Black Hat, SOURCE, BSides, OMFW, GFirst, and DFRWS. Websites: http://memoryanalysis.net.

  * **Brendan Dolan-Gavitt** ([@moyix](https://twitter.com/moyix)) is a sixth year Ph.D. student at Georgia Tech, working in the Georgia Tech Information Security Center (GTISC). His interests lie in the area of systems security, and in particular finding ways to use virtualization to improve the security of commodity operating systems like Windows. Brendan is also active in the rapidly growing field of memory forensics, and has published papers on extracting forensically relevant information from images of RAM. He received his B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science from Wesleyan University in 2006, and spent two years working as an information security analyst and researcher for the MITRE Corporation. Currently, he is co-advised by Dr. Jonathon Giffin and Dr. Wenke Lee. Websites: http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~brendan,  http://moyix.blogspot.com.

  * **Jamie Levy** ([@gleeda](https://twitter.com/gleeda)) is a senior researcher and developer at Terremark Worldwide, A Verizon Company. Prior to joining Terremark, she worked on various R&D projects and forensic cases at Guidance Software, Inc. Jamie has taught classes in Computer Forensics and Computer Science at Queens College (CUNY) and John Jay College (CUNY). She has an MS in Forensic Computing from John Jay College and is an avid contributor to the open source Computer Forensics community. She is an active developer on the Volatility Framework. Jamie has authored peer-reviewed conference publications and presented at conferences (OMFW, CEIC, IEEE ICC) on the topics of memory, network, and malware forensics analysis.

  * **Michael Ligh** ([@iMHLv2](https://twitter.com/iMHLv2)) is a reverse engineer who specializes in vulnerability research, malware cryptography, memory forensics and sandbox scripting/automation. He's co-author of [Malware Analyst's Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/dp/0470613033?tag=malwacookb-20&camp=14573&creative=327641&linkCode=as1&creativeASIN=0470613033&adid=1TMVPBANFRG85VFRMRXW&&ref-refURL=http%3A%2F%2Fmnin.org%2F), Director of Malware Research at Terremark, and designer of the malware plugins and win32k suite (windows GUI memory) for Volatility. Michael has taught advanced malware RCE courses to students in London, Malaysia, Brazil, Shanghai, and several major hubs in the U.S. including D.C and New York. Notable recent presentations include Debuggers and Decryptor Development (Defcon 16), Making Fun of Your Malware (Defcon 17), and Tracking Stuxnet in Memory with Volatility (OMFW 2011).

  * **AAron Walters** ([@4tphi](https://twitter.com/4tphi)) is lead developer of the Volatility project, founding partner of Volatile Systems, LLC. and chair of Open Memory Forensics Workshop (OMFW). AAron's initial research (circa 2006) into memory analysis led to the creation of FATKit (A Framework for the Extraction and Analysis of Digital Forensic Data from Volatile System Memory) and volatools - both groundbreaking developments which helped shape how today's digital investigators analyze RAM. He graduated with an M.S. from Purdue University, won first place in the 2008 DFRWS challenge, and has published several articles in journals such as IEEE and Digital Investigation Journal. AAron has presented or participated in panels at conferences such as Blackhat, DFRWS, Cloud Computing Expo, AFCEA Homeland Security Conference, DoD Cyber Crime Conference, and Hacker Halted.
