# Introduction #

This page documents the things we want to accomplish in the 2.2 branch, so we can a) keep track of them, and b) people new to the project can find things to work on.

# To Do for 2.2 #

  * Linux support
  * Android support (very simple basically uses the Linux support)
  * Mac support
  * Anything leftover from 2.1 (eg, registry hive AS)
  * Faster/better KDBG and DTB scanners
  * Auto profile selection (see [Issue #268](https://code.google.com/p/volatility/issues/detail?id=#268))
  * Pool scanner groups (see scudette branch) for scanning for multiple pool tags with one pass
  * Bring x64 support to timers, callbacks, idt/gdt, and apihooks malware plugins
  * Add MHL's win32k suite (10+ plugins and API for investigating GUI memory released summer 2012)

## Additional tasks ##

  * Windows 8 and Server 2012 support?
